In his role as Partner Services Manager for SEA, I experienced many instances of his adept conflict resolution and clear communication abilities both with external and internal key stakeholders. Beyond his role, Kuldeep stood out to me for being extremely passionate and dedicated to early talents, providing us prioritised attention and support in our works and development. In a crucial time when the organization is restructuring coupled with us navigating our first full-time year, Kuldeep had taken the initiative to lead engagements with ECTs and had done wonderfully in following through with the statements and ideas he committed to. Kuldeep has been benevolent with his encouragements which were one of the cornerstones in leveling our confidence and potential to greater heights + in the right direction. To me, Kuldeep is a great leader and a down-to-earth professional whom I can trust and go to for advice. Thank you for always being open to my perspectives and I look forward to creating more great work together! :)",

Penguin Books was originally founded in the UK in 1935 by Allen Lane, who envisioned a collection of quality, attractive books affordable enough to be “bought as easily and casually as a packet of cigarettes.” A United States office opened in 1939, called Penguin Books Ltd. The group merged with Putnam Berkley to become Penguin Putnam, Inc. in 1996, Penguin Group (USA) in 2003, and Penguin Publishing Group in 2014.\n\nToday, Penguin Publishing Group is the largest division of Penguin Random House, Inc.\n",

New company, new role and new manager is a triple whammy to any recent graduate; however within couple of months Ravi put me in ease. He lead the critical and challenging customer meetings with me and i got to see the art of putting customer at ease, live. \n\nWith great business acumen and strategic thought process, Ravi is a great trouble shooter for all challenges and problems, both within and outside the company. \nHe instills a sense of integrity towards work and is as much invested in team's development as he is for customer's.   \nA rare asset in any company, Ravi earns my highest recommendation as a leader.",

        "description": "Cipla is a leading global pharmaceutical company trusted by healthcare professionals and patients across the world since 1935. A compassionate approach to healthcare that goes beyond the pursuit of profit and growth has been the force impelling Cipla’s history over the years.\n\nOur credo and our purpose of ‘Caring for Life' continues to guide our actions towards our people and the planet for creating a sustainable future. Cipla today has presence in 80+ countries, providing over 1,500 products across various therapeutic categories in 50+ dosage forms. \n\nKeeping with our legacy of care, we constantly strive to ensure access to high-quality medicines that make a difference in the lives of patients. \n\nOur paradigm-changing offer of a triple anti-retroviral (ARV) therapy in HIV/AIDS at less than a dollar a day in Africa in 2001 was pivotal in bringing inclusiveness, accessibility and affordability to the centre of the HIV movement. \n\nAn unmatched presence across the care continuum (awareness, prevention, diagnosis, treatment and adherence) and the widest range of drug-device combinations has established Cipla’s respiratory leadership in India and other key emerging markets. Armed with this legacy and a deep understanding of the lungs, we have articulated our aspiration to become a global lung leader and help millions breathe free.\n",
